#Ingredients
-4 large eggs
-2/3 cup milk , (160 ml)
-1/4 cup all-purpose flour , (30 grams)
-1/4 cup granulated sugar , (50 grams)
-1/4 teaspoon salt
-1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-1 teaspoon vanilla extract , (5 ml)
-8 thick slices bread


#Instructions
Preheat griddle to 350 degrees F or or heat a skillet over medium heat.
In a blender, add the eggs, milk, flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Blend until smooth. If you prefer whisking by hand, start by mixing the flour and eggs together in a shallow dish, then whisk in the rest of the ingredients until combined.
Dip bread slices into the batter, dredging them well on both sides, and place on hot, greased griddle or skillet.
Cook for a few minutes, until the bottom of the breads starts to get golden brown. Flip and cook on the other side the same. 
Remove to a plate. Serve warm with syrup and a sprinkle of powdered sugar.
