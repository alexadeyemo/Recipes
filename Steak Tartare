#Method
step 1
Trim the beef, discarding any sinew, then finely chop using a large, heavy knife. Put in a bowl and add the shallot, cornichons, capers and parsley. Add the mustard and hot sauce to taste. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.

step 2
Mix together lightly, then spoon into the centres of two small, chilled plates. Roughly shape into a round, then make an indentation in each. Place an egg yolk into each hollow and serve straightaway with a toasted baguette or French fries.
